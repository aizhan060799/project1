# **ProShop App CI/CD Deployment**

  
## Overview


The ProShop application is an e-commerce platform that we are deploying via a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The goal of this project is to configure the application to be built and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster with GitHub Actions, using Docker for building the images and AWS ECR as the image registry.**

## Architecture

The architecture of the ProShop CI/CD deployment includes the following components:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Implemented using GitHub Actions to automate build and deployment processes.
   - Uses Docker for image building and tagging.
   - Pushes Docker images to AWS ECR.

2. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Deployed using Helm charts to manage frontend and backend applications.
   - Ingress-nginx controller is used for routing and TLS termination.
   - AWS Secrets Manager and Kubernetes SecretProviderClass are used for managing sensitive information.

3. **Environment Management**:
   - Configured to support development, staging, and production environments.
   - Separate Helm values files (`dev-values.yaml`, `staging-values.yaml`, `prod-values.yaml`) are used to manage different environment configurations.

4. **Security**:
   - TLS certificates obtained via Letâ€™s Encrypt provide secure connections.
   - AWS Secrets Manager manages sensitive credentials, ensuring secure integration with Kubernetes.


## Project Goals

-  **CI/CD Setup**: Automate the build and deployment of the ProShop app using GitHub Actions.

-  **Kubernetes Deployment**: Use Helm charts to manage the deployment of both frontend and backend applications into a Kubernetes cluster.

-  **Environment Management**: Configure the application for multiple environments (development, staging, and production), with a focus on the development environment.

-  **Security**: Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage sensitive credentials and integrate them securely with the Kubernetes cluster.


## Features


-  **Docker Image Build**: The application is containerized and built using Docker.

-  **AWS ECR**: Docker images are pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with repository immutability enabled.

-  **Helm for Deployment**: Both frontend and backend applications are deployed using Helm charts. Separate `dev-values.yaml`, `staging-values.yaml`, and `prod-values.yaml` are created for each environment.

-  **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automates the build and deployment process with environment-specific variables.

-  **TLS Configuration**: The application is secured with TLS certificates obtained via Let's Encrypt.

-  **AWS Secrets Manager**: Sensitive information such as database credentials is securely managed via AWS Secrets Manager and integrated with Kubernetes using the SecretProviderClass.

  
## Prerequisites
  

-  **AWS Account**: Access to AWS resources such as ECR, IAM, and Secrets Manager.

-  **Kubernetes Cluster**: A running Kubernetes cluster with an Ingress-nginx controller configured.

-  **GitHub Repository**: Access to a GitHub repository for the ProShop application.

-  **Helm**: Installed locally to manage Kubernetes resources.

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates the following:
Building Docker images for both the frontend and backend applications. Pushing the images to AWS ECR with immutability enabled. Deploying the application using Helm into a Kubernetes cluster.
- Using Git SHA for versioning and tagging Docker images.

- IAM Role: A role named GitHubActionsCICDrole-proshop is used to build and push images to ECR. Ensure the trust policy is configured to allow access from your GitHub repository using OpenID Connect.

- Kubernetes Access: Ensure the IAM role has permissions to create Kubernetes objects (e.g., deployments, pods, etc.) and eks permissions to allow deployment into the cluster. Manually update the `aws-auth` ConfigMap in AWS EKS cluster to map the IAM role to a Kubernetes user or group, enabling the necessary permissions for deployments.

- Environment Variables: Store the IAM_ROLE ARN in GitHub repository settings for use in the pipeline.

**Helm Chart Deployment**
Helm charts are used to deploy both the frontend and backend applications. Values files for each environment are configured, although only the development environment (dev-values.yaml) will be used for this project.

- dev-values.yaml: Used for the development environment.

- staging-values.yaml: Configured for future use in staging.

- prod-values.yaml: Configured for future use in production.

**Database Connectivity**
AWS Secrets Manager is used to store and manage database credentials securely. These credentials are integrated with Kubernetes Secrets using the SecretProviderClass from AWS Secrets Manager

**TLS Security**
Obtain a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt or use an existing Wildcard Certificate. Store the certificate in a Kubernetes secret. Reference the TLS certificate in Ingress rules to provide TLS termination at the ingress controller.


## Issues Faced

1. **Docker Image Tagging Errors**:
   - **Issue**: Errors when tagging Docker images with Git SHA.
   - **Solution**: Adjusted GitHub Actions YAML for proper Git SHA extraction and tagging.

2. **ECR Push Permissions**:
   - **Issue**: Insufficient permissions for pushing images to ECR.
   - **Solution**: Updated IAM role policies to include necessary ECR permissions.

3. **Helm Chart Configuration**:
   - **Issue**: Initial misconfigurations in Helm values files.
   - **Solution**: Corrected values files and tested different environments.

4. **Ingress TLS Setup**:
   - **Issue**: TLS certificate misapplication due to incorrect Ingress rules.
   - **Solution**: Updated Ingress rules to properly reference the TLS secret.

5. **SecretProviderClass Misconfiguration**:
   - **Issue**: The SecretProviderClass was incorrectly configured, causing secrets to fail to mount in pods.
   - **Solution**: Corrected the SecretProviderClass definition and ensured that the correct object names and namespaces were specified.

6. **Permissions for AWS Secrets Manager**:
   - **Issue**: Initial permission errors occurred when attempting to fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Solution**: Updated the IAM role policies to include `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, allowing Kubernetes to access secrets securely.

7. **Database Connectivity Issue**:
   - **Issue**: Backend pods failed to connect to the database, causing service downtime.
   - **Solution**: Checked environment variables, verified secrets, tested network connectivity, and ensured the IAM role had permissions for AWS Secrets Manager.

8. **Docker Image Build for Linux/AMD64 Compatibility**:
   - **Issue**: Docker images built on ARM64 (e.g., Apple M1/M2) were not compatible with Linux/AMD64 in production, causing runtime errors.
   - **Solution**: Used Docker's `--platform=linux/amd64` flag during the build process:
     ```bash
     docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t <image-name> .
     ```

## Troubleshooting Backend Database Connectivity

If the backend cannot connect to the database:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Use `kubectl exec <backend-pod-name> -- env` to verify correct variables.
2. **Verify Secrets**: Use `kubectl describe pod <backend-pod-name>` to check if secrets are mounted.
3. **Test Network Connectivity**: Use `curl <db-cluster-endpoint>:27017` to confirm connection.
4. **Inspect Pod Logs**: Use `kubectl logs <backend-pod-name>` to identify connection errors.
5. **Check Database Status**: Confirm the database is running and accessible in AWS.
